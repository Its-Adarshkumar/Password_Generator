# 🔐 React Password Generator

Today I learned and practiced some essential **React Hooks** and integrated **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## 📚 What I Did

✅ Explored React Hooks like:
- `useCallback`: for memoizing the password generation function.
- `useRef`: to access and copy the generated password directly.
- `useEffect`: to handle side effects like updating the password when input options change.

✅ Built a responsive and clean **Password Generator** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

✅ Added a **copy-to-clipboard** feature using `useRef`.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖱️ One-click copy to clipboard.
- ⚙️ Customize length, characters, numbers, and symbols.
- 💡 Built using modern **React Hooks**.
- 🎨 Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and clean UI.
